# My website :)

## Tech Stack

[[‚ù§Ô∏è]](https://github.com/Xiddoc/xiddoc.github.io/tree/master/src) Made with ReactJS, 
graciously hosted for free with GitHub pages.

[[üíª]](https://github.com/Xiddoc/xiddoc.github.io/tree/master/old_website) Previously used a mix of HTML & JS for the 
frontend, and a Python Flask server powered by Gunicorn as the WSGI. Used to run on an Ubuntu server I configured on 
an old laptop.

## Domain Hunting

My work is hosted at [iliketo.party](https://iliketo.party) (_I like to party_... get it?)

I chose this domain mainly because of price. Specifically, I wrote a bit of code to hunt for the cheapest TLD 
(top level domain, basically the "party" part of "iliketo.party").
